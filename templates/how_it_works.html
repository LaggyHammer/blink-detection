<h3>Blink detection using facial landmark recognition</h3>
<p>Using dlib's face detector, faces are detected in each frame of a video stream.
Iterating over each detected face, we predict the facial landmarks using a pre-trained predictor.
</p>
<p>The landmarks for each eye are isolated & an average aspect ratio for the eyes is calculated.
If this ratio falls below a certain customizable threshold for _'n'_ consecutive frames,
the blink counter is increased.
